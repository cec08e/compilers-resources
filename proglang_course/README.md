This directory contains the lecture notes and project writeups/solutions for the Programming Languages (COP4020) course that I taught approximately 5 times at Florida State University between Spring 2015 and Summer 2017.

1. Lecture notes are contained in the lectures folder.
2. Project 1, a basic lexical analyzer generated by the lex utility for a basic language called CALC, is contained in lexer_calc.
3. Project 2, a basic parser (with some semantic rules) for the CALC language using lex and yacc utilities, is contained in calc_semantics.
4. Additional lex and yacc demos for the class are provided in lex_demos and yacc_demos respectively.
