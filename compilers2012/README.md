My project solutions from the Fall 2012 offering of Compiler Construction at FSU. Each subdirectory corresponds to one project in the course. This course covered all of the major phases of the compilation process including lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, target code generation, and optimization.
The textbook for this course was "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman
(or also known as the dragon book).

Each project in this course focused on implementing a different phase of a compiler that took a large subset of the C programming language as input and produced a SPARC assembly language program as output (which was ultimately assembled and executed on the FSU departmentâ€™s SPARC machine).
